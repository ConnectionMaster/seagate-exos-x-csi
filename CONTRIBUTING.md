# How to contribute on this project

* Create a new branch, or if the changes are minor checkout `develop` **(but not `master`)**.
* Commit using [the angular commit messages](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines). This matters because it will be parsed by the CI.
* Pull request your branch into `develop`.
* If you'd like to create a new release, pull request your changes into `master`.
